# Multi-Signature-Wallet
A multi signature wallet is a type of digital wallet that requires multiple signatures or approvals from different users or devices before any transaction can be authorized and executed. This enhances the security of the wallet and protects against unauthorized access or fraudulent activities.

In a multi signature wallet on 5irechain, each user or device has their own private key, which is used to sign transactions. However, instead of a single private key being required to authorize a transaction, multiple private keys are needed. The number of required signatures or approvals is determined by the owner of the wallet, and can be set to any number between 2 and 15.
